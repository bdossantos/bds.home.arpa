- **Horizontal Stacks**: Better use of mobile screen real estate
- **Simplified Navigation**: Clear view organization

## Entity Customization

### Enhanced Naming Convention

- Sensors: Clear indication of measurement type and location
- Switches: Intuitive names for function

### Icon Mapping
- Room lighting: Room-specific icons (sofa, bed, chef-hat)
- Individual lights: Type-specific icons (floor-lamp, lava-lamp)
- Sensors: Function-specific icons (thermometer, motion-sensor)
- System: Status-appropriate icons (battery, power, gauge)

## User Experience Improvements
